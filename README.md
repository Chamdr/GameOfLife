# Game of Life Kata

## Kata Principles

Coding Katas are small algorithmic exercises design to improve oneself. Their goal is to show your problem solving skills.

Due to their small scale, they are the perfect conditions to showcase all your best practices (TDD, Baby steps, Clean Code, ...).

## Instructions

Implement [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

You start with a two dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either alive or dead. In this version of the problem, the grid is finite, and no life can exist off the edges. When calculating the next generation of the grid, follow these rules:

   1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
   2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
   3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
   4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

## Scripts

- `clean` - remove coverage data, Jest cache and transpiled files,
- `prebuild` - lint source files and tests before building,
- `build` - transpile TypeScript to ES6,
- `build:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically transpile source files,
- `lint` - lint source files and tests,
- `prettier` - reformat files,
- `test` - run tests,
- `test:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests
